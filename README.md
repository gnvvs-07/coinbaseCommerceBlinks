> **⚠️ Caution: Image URLs in Coinbase Beta Ecommerce**
>
> Currently, Coinbase Beta Ecommerce is in beta and **does not support upload image Functionality** in its API or dashboard. To display product images in your store:
>
> - **Paste the image URL as the very first line** in the product's description field in your Coinbase Ecommerce dashboard.
> - After the image URL, add the actual product description on the after that.
>
> This workaround ensures your product images are shown correctly in the app, even though the platform itself does not natively support image uploads.
